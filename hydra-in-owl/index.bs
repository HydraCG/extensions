Introduction {#intro}
=====================

This extensions describes [[!Hydra|Hydra Core Vocabulary]] terms using [[!owl2-overview|Web Ontology Language]] (OWL).
It neither present any new Hydra terms nor replaces any existing definitions. It SHOULD be used in conjunction with the
[[!Hydra|Hydra Core Vocabulary]] specification as it is a complementary specification.

It's purpose is purely to describe all the terms with pure [[!rdf-schema|Resource Description Framework Schema]] (RDFS) and
[[!owl2-overview|Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) ontologies so is is possible to either validate hydra constructs or use it with
RDF reasoners.
