Introduction {#intro}
=====================

This extensions describes [[!Hydra|Hydra Core Vocabulary]] terms using [[!SHACL|Shapes Constraint Language]] (SHACL).
It neither present any new Hydra terms nor replaces any existing definitions. It SHOULD be used in conjunction with the
[[!Hydra|Hydra Core Vocabulary]] specification as it is a complementary specification.

It's purpose is purely to describe all the terms with pure [[!RDFS|Resource Description Framework Schema]] (RDFS) and
[[!SHACL|Shapes Constraint Language]] (SHACL) vocabulary so is is possible to validate hydra constructs.
